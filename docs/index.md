# Ubuntu Kernel documentation

The Ubuntu Linux kernel is the core software enabling applications on Ubuntu to
interact with system resources.

The Ubuntu kernel handles communication between system hardware and user-space
applications, managing tasks like memory, processing, and security. Regular
stable release updates (SRU) ensure the kernel stays secure, stable, and
optimized.

Ubuntu kernels provide a reliable foundation for applications and system
processes, meeting the need for secure, high-performance, Ubuntu environments.
Kernels are also tested consistently for regressions to provide users with a
reliable and smooth experience. Kernels are tailor made for Ubuntu Desktop,
Ubuntu Server, a wide range of architectures, IoT devices, cloud providers, and
more.

This documentation serves developers, partners, and others working with Ubuntu
kernels, offering guidance on kernel workflows, tools, SRU timelines, and
processes for customization and maintenance.
